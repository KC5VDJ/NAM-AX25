# NAM-AX25
Cyber NOS 2 AX.25 subsystem

This will come after Pi-DI, due to effort involved, and the need for Pi-DI as a prerequisite for intended testing.

This project is queued before NAM-IGCN, as an initial dive into NAM/CCP, as AX.25 is ADCCP Balanced mode compliant, a lot of code might just need modified and stripped / augmented, but not a complete from-scratch protocol like NAM-LTP will be.
